# hadoop sandbox attempt
This was an experience. I initially was not able to get hadoop to work via docker because I did not have docker on my mac. I had to update my mac in order to be able to install Docker because I had a super old version. I tried other methods but essentially had NO space on my computer. I took this as a final sign to buy a new computer because I knew I was going to run into further issues throughout my capstone project and other courses. I had my mac for 8 years so it was time.

I was able to get a new one this weekend. I downloaded docker and started with the wsw repo but got a 'Error response from daemon: network hbase not found'. I have a mac with the M3 chip and I remembered that you suggested to use the EU repo but I essentially got the same error message :(. I than began watching your video tutorial and realized I did not really understand how to move through directories, but now I got the hang of it *a bit*. Then I saw the suggestion of using sandbox hadoop which was MUCH smoother!
