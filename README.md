# hadoop sandbox attempt
This was an experience. I initially was not able to get hadoop to work via docker because I did not have docker on my mac. I had to update my mac in order to be able to install Docker because I had a super old version. I tried other methods but essentially had NO space on my computer. I took this as a final sign to buy a new computer because I knew I was going to run into further issues throughout my capstone project and other courses. I had my mac for 8 years so it was time.
